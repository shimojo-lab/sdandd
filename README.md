# sD&D (security Defense and Dungeons)
We have been developed a security educational game platform that named sD&D. So, the sD&D aim to build a network information security game with scalability and flexibility components to provide modifiable content information for latest cybersecurity education. The design of sD&D network games was inspired by limitations of analog board game such as complexity of the game rules that prevented player to comprehend information security knowledges hidden in the game. Analog board games' limitation also difficulties to let new players join in the middle of the game, so that the game must be restarted to accommodate new players who joins later.
